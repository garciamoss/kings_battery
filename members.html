      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Why do you do reenacting?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>Because it is fun! Everyone who is involved in this hobby has at least some interest in American History— or more specifically, the Civil War. We all have a desire to learn more about it. Civil War reenacting is also used to educate the public about various facets of the time period that rarely get mentioned in any classroom or book. It is one thing to read about it, it is a completely different matter to see it done first hand and experience it.</p>
          <p>Many reenactors’ feelings are best summed up by the following quotation from historian Bruce Catton: </p>
          <p>&quot;We are people to whom the past is forever speaking. We listen to it because we cannot help ourselves. For the past speaks with many voices. For out of that nowhere which is the time before we were born, men who were flesh of our flesh, bone of our bone, went through fire and storm to break a path to the future. We are a part of the future they died for. We cannot cut ourselves from it. It is a basic part of our heritage as Americans.&quot;</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Is this a political organization?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Absolutely not. We are living historians who feel that much of our Southern heritage has been lost or horribly distorted in the post-war years beginning with Reconstruction. We are not part of, nor will ever be involved with, any racist organization or other hate group. We frown on the misuse of our battle flag by such groups for their own selfish ends. We DO support the flying of the battle flag as a remembrance of our gallant Southern heroes.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">What do you do at reenactments?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>Most of the time is spent conversing with and educating the public. Usually an encampment is laid out and spectators walk through.  This gives them an opportunity to ask questions and see the daily minutia of soldierly life. Depending on your commitment level in reenacting, you may wish to answer their questions in a third person format (i.e..They did this...They had that...etc) or you may do so in First Person. First Person is where you assume the personality, dialect, attitude, and beliefs of a character. You will then act him out as if you were actually living during the 1860’s. This is the most intense form of reenacting and requires much research, dedication, and time into your character and the time period he represents. Although it can be quite difficult, when done properly it is very rewarding. </p>
          <p>We also relax with friends we have not seen for awhile and have the chance to make new friends. Many of us like camping, and usually on the first night of a event we spend long hours just talking around the camp fire.</p>
          <p>There are also battles. These take place during the afternoon and give the reenactors and spectators an opportunity to witness the sights and sounds of Civil War combat. Often times, a small portion of an actual battle will be scripted out and reenacted.  There are times though, when there is no script, and the battles are determined by the skill of the commanders and their knowledge of Civil War tactics. These are called tacticals. Once the battles are over, and the sun has dropped below the horizon, many events have a Saturday night ball in which Ladies and Gentlemen do period dances to period music.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Where are the events held?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Civil War reenactments are held nationwide, and, indeed, around the world. Our unit concentrates on events in the southeast, generally about three to five hours from our base in north central Georgia. One or two times a year, we venture farther for large reenactments. In recent years, we’ve participated in events in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">When do you have reenactments?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>Our reenacting season takes place between mid/late January and November. Because of the hot, humid summers here in Georgia we generally refrain from participating in events held during June through mid-September. Check our events schedule to see when we will be attending events. </p>
          <p>Typically, camp is set up on Friday night for many events and they can run through Sunday afternoon. However, some events may be just one day. We would love for you to be able to stay the entire event, but we understand that people are busy.  If you can only make it out for one day of an event, we would love to have you. We only ask of you what you are able to give and are willing to donate. We are always looking for fresh recruits to join our ranks!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">What is a “galvanized<br />
          Yankee?” </div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>“Galvanized Yankees” was a term from the American Civil War used to refer to former Confederate prisoners of war who had sworn allegiance to the Union. Due to doubts about their ultimate loyalty, Galvanized Yankees were generally assigned to garrison forts far from the Civil War battlefields or in action against American Indians in the west.</p>
          <p>In Civil War reenactments, it is necessary to “galvanize” select units when one side is overrepresented for an accurate portrayal of an event; for example, there may be too many Confederate reenactors and not enough Federal for an accurate portrayal of the Battle of Atlanta. The affected units are often notified by the event sponsor or representative well in advance. This is not an uncommon occurance as many CW reenacting units adopt an alternate identity to accomodate this. Though King’s Battery is primarily a Confederate unit, we’re also the 13th N.Y. Independent when galvanized.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Do you have meetings?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Yes; we have monthly events from late January through December, so there is ample opportunity to meet and talk. We hold an annual meeting in late January — a business meeting at which we plan the year’s events and conduct elections.</div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How can I try out reenacting?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>It’s easy!  Simply use the form on our “Contact” page, and we will get you in contact with our Recruitment Officer. He will be able to answer any questions you may have.  We are always looking for good soldiers to join our ranks!</p>
          <p>If you have never seen the unit at a reenactment or a living history, it is always wise to check out a unit before joining. In addition, it is often possible, with lead-time, for us to assemble proper uniforms and equipment for loan so you can experience camp life or even a battle.</p>
          <p>If you are in our area (Atlanta suburbs), look at our schedule. If you would like to come out and participate with us, email us and let us know so we can look for you. We have extra uniforms and other equipment for you to use before you make a decision about joining. If you don't live in our area, spend some time browsing our links page. You may be able to find a group near you.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Which unit is right for me?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>Each reenactment group has its own &quot;personality.&quot; We recognize this and respect those differences. We would not be offended if you decide to join another unit, one that matches more closely your own preferences.  Some units are strictly family-style, with relaxed and less-authentic encampments; some units stress authenticity down to the smallest detail. We try to do both, allowing a selection of events that satisfy the members’ needs for conviviality as well as more demanding “campaign-style” activities.</p>
          <p>If you are still undecided about which unit to join, you can simply begin by purchasing equipment that is standard for all units. These are items you will need no matter which unit you join.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Can I try it to see if I like it?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Absolutely. Safety is our prime concern. If you come to an event having never drilled before, our Sergeant Major, in his capacity as safety officer will make an assessment as to whether you will be allowed to participate in battle scenarios. Camping and drilling with us is allowed as long as we have sufficient equipment to outfit you. </div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How much does all of the equipment cost?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">This is the BIG question! It can cost anywhere from $1,000.00 to $1,500.00. Keep in mind though, you do not have to purchase everything all at one time. As stated above, you can borrow any equipment that you do not yet have. Almost everyone acquires their equipment over time.</div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Do I have to have all of my gear by my first event?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>No. Actually, we would prefer that you wait to purchase anything until you have had the opportunity to attend an event.  This will give you an opportunity to see if you enjoy being with our group and if the hobby is worth getting into before you start laying down money.  There is nothing worse than buying all of your equipment only to discover you don’t enjoy the hobby!</p>
          <p>Any equipment that you do not have, you can borrow from the Unit. We do ask that you try to acquire all of your basic equipment in a reasonable amount of time so that other new recruits lacking equipment may also participate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">What do I buy? Where do I buy equipment?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>We suggest that your first purchases be your shoes, canteen, and hat.  Because everyone’s feet and head are different, it is really difficult to borrow these items and have a proper fit.  Also, if you have to wear glasses, we ask that you acquire period frames.  You can then take these frames and have your prescription lenses put in.</p>
          <p>We have a suggested vendor/sutler list located on the &quot;Links Page&quot;. They have been chosen because we feel that they provide the best quality and authenticity for the most practical price.  We ask that when you begin purchasing items, you start by checking out the sutlers from this list.  It also helps to talk to a member of the authenticity committee or experienced member of the Unit, they can give you a hand when picking out equipment.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">When should I buy a uniform?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">DO NOT buy any uniform until you are sure what unit you would like to enlist with. Every unit’s uniform is a little different. Once you join a group, talk to someone in the unit before you buy.</div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">What kind of commitment is involved?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">As there is no set time commitment, the biggest commitment is to present living history in the most accurate way possible, by creating the best impression and emulation of your 19th century persona. Our experienced members are more than happy to help new members develop their impressions.</div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Is there any type of safety training?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">YES! All members, both new and established, must pass a weapons certification course prior to participating in any firing senarios. A minimum age of 16 is required to load and fire a cannon. Side arms and &quot;Bowie Knives&quot; are not allowed at any time. At all events, certified EMT's are present to render assistance.</div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Drill? What is that?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Drill is where we practice handling the cannon and maneuvers that were used during the Civil War. A soldier’s life during the war mainly consisted of drill, drill, and more drill. They were extremely proficient at it.  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) we cannot spend every waking moment practicing drill. Usually we will drill twice at an event: once Saturday morning and once Sunday morning. Drill allows us to look and maneuver as a real Civil War Unit, but it is also important for safety. Even though we are shooting blanks, a powder burn is nothing to laugh about.</div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">So you want to be a civilian reenactor?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>Civilian reenacting is just as serious as military reenacting, minus the guns.</p>
          <p>The civilians of King’s Battery represent the working class in rural Georgia during the time of the American Civil War. The majority of these people were from farms and small towns—the people who did the hard labor and barely eked out a living while the plantation owners lounged and lived in mansions large enough for more than one family. The men would labor at farming the fields, or if they were lucky they might be able to work in a trade such as leatherwork or blacksmithing. The women were the ones who did the laundry, scrubbed floors and windows, cooked, sewed - anything they could to earn a few pennies.</p>
          <p>Currently we are exploring the options of demonstrations of the types of handiwork the women would have done. As King’s Battery is a family oriented organization, we encourage participation from both sexes as well as the children of families.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
<div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">I’m convinced. How do I join?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
          <p>You should contact our unit recruiters by the form on our “Contacts” page. You will be invited to participate at a field event. Once you have that experience under your belt, you will be sent an application that you should complete and return with your dues to cover unit expenses, upkeep of the company flags, and other necessities. If it is near the end of the season, we may waive or prorate the dues until January. This will be explained by the unit’s secretary.</p>
          <p>As soon as you officially join, you will have a “sponsor” or NCO assigned. This veteran member will contact you directly and begin the process of orientation. He will provide you with standards and suggestions about the uniforms and equipment you should order, the schedule of coming events, and the expectations of the company.</p>
